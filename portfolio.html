                <h1>Text and Spatial Analysis of Swiss Parliamentary Speeches</h1>
                <p>
                    This report examines the Swiss parliamentary speeches across various dimensions. Through text and spatial analysis techniques, further insights on languages, cantons, congresspeople, factions and topics covered have been extracted. A variety of datasets have been employed throughout this project; the most important between all of these is the SwissParliamentarySpeeches dataset, this file stores all speeches given in the Swiss Parliament since 1999.

                <h1>Financial Modelling Challenge</h1>
                <p>
                    The challenge was about creating a fictional fund and developing its strategy from scratch.
                    Our portfolio has been created and managed with Bloomberg. Moreover, we also used Excel for data analysis and to compute metrics. Finally, we used Python to automate repetitive stuff.
                    Beside designing and monitoring our portfolio we also edited reports for investors.
                    <br>
                    The strategies we implemented were:
                    <br>
                    - Discretionary Investing
                    <br>
                    - Quantitative Investing
                    <br>
                    - Macro Investing

                    This project explores various aspects of Runge-Kutta methods. The project is composed by three blocks. 
                    <br>
                    First: Implementing collocation methods of arbitrary order, with a particular emphasis on Gauss and Radau methods.
